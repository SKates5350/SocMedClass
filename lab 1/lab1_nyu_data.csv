"250829409716","NYU Abu Dhabi","""I went for an emergency heart surgery on New Year's Day 2011. I was supposed to go under for seven hours but there were complications and they couldn't restart my heart. My doctor did not give up on me. I had to learn to walk, and do everything all over again. I just set lots of little goals, achieving one step at a time.""
